# Rock_Paper_Scissors_Lizard_Spock

##Summary

This started out as a pair programming exercise from Week 7 of the immersive coding course at [CodeClan](https://codeclan.com/), which I later refactored and extended. It's one of the first apps I made in Android Studio.

* The user can choose to play either Rock, Paper, Scissors or Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock against the app. (Just in case you haven't been watching _The Big Bang Theory_, the originator of the Lizard, Spock version has [a page explaining how it works](http://www.samkass.com/theories/RPSSL.html).)
* The user chooses their weapon; so does the app. 
* Wins, losses and draws are counted.
